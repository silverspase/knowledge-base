# Variables and Mutability

`variables` are immutable by default. To make it mutable add `mut` after `let`
`constants`:
-  `mut` doesn't work after `const`
- Upper-Snake-Cased
- are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope they were declared in

## Shadowing

You can use the same name with let declaration, you can even change type
 
```
fn main() {
    let x = "5"; // string type
    let x = x.parse::<i32>().unwrap() + 1; // convert to int and add 1
    {
        let x = x * 2; // inner scope, which doesn't shadow
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
// The value of x in the inner scope is: 12  
// The value of x is: 6 
```

# Data Types

Rust is a _statically typed_ language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

## Annotation

Is the way to tell Rust about the value type, for example:
```
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```
If we dont specify guess type with `: u32` , compiler will return error because several data types can parsed from string.

## Scalar Types

A scalar type represents a single value(ntegers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters).

### Integer

- integer types default to `i32`
- Signed integers has sign - plus or minus. (range  is from-(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1, for example `i8` can store numbers from `-(27) to 27 - 1` = ` -128 to 127`)
- Unsigned integers are >=0 (range is from 0 to 2n - 1. `u8` can store numbers `from 0 to 28 - 1 = 0 to 255`)
- `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on.
- Number literals can also use `_` as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`
- Integer Overflow in in debug mode compiling will cause a panic, in release mode with the `--release` flag those checks are absent and it will end up with wrap around (for u8 256 will be 0, 257 will be 1 etc.)
- Integer division rounds down to the nearest integer.

### Foating-point

The default type is `f64` (not f32) and all floating-point types are signed
```
let x = 2.0; // f64
let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
```

### Booleans

Booleans are one byte in size

### Characters

Rust’s `char` type is the most primitive alphabetic type. 
```
let c = 'z'; // single quotes
```

Rust’s `char` type is four bytes in size  and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII.

## Compound Types

Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

### The Tuple Type

- groups together different data types.
- has fixed fixed length
```
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
```
To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:
```
let (x, y, z) = tup;
```

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`), starting from zero:
```
let five_hundred = tup.2;
```

The tuple without any values has a special name, _unit_. This value also represents an empty value or an empty return type.

### The Array Type

- same type of elements
- fixed size
```
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let b: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

You can also initialize an array to contain the same value
```
let a = [3; 5]; // let a = [3; 5];
```


## Functions

```
fn sum(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b 
}
```
or
```
fn sum(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}
```

In first example there is no semicolon because it’s an expression whose value we want to return. If we place a semicolon at the end of the line containing `a + b`, it will change from an expression to a statement, and we need an explicit return to aviod an error.



_Statement_ doesn't have a returning a value.
_Expression_ has a returning value.

Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression, for example:
```
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
// The value of y is: 4
```

Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.

## Comments

Sililar to Golang but there is no `/* */`  multiline comment option

# Control Flow

# Using if in a let Statement

Because if is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a let statement to assign the outcome to a variable:
```
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

## Repetition with Loops

`break` and `continue` also present in Rust.
If you have loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost loop at that point.
You can target the outside loop by marking it wil label and then using this label with `break` or `continue` statement:
```
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}

```

### loop

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.
```
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

You might also need to pass the result of that operation out of the loop.  To do this, you can add the value you want returned after the `break` expression. After the loop, we use a semicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to `result`:
```
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}"); 
}
// The result is 20
```

### while

While is Conditional Loop, the loop runs as long as conditional is true:
```
let mut number = 1;
while number < 4 {
	number += 1;
	println!("{number}!");
}
```

### for
`for` runs over the collection (range in golang):
```
let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

for element in a {
	println!("the value is: {element}");
}
```

Also you can use for instead of while:
```
for number in 1..4 { // golang: number := 1; number < 4; number++
	println!("{number}!");
}
```
